                I present to you my little nephew, Eliseo. He was born on June 14, 2020. He is a very funny baby and a fast learner. He likes to go to my room and makes a mess. He is intelligent because whenever he sees me in the kitchen he runs to my room knowing that I left my door open, so he can go in. He loves attention and he loves us and we love him back.

                He's also a imitator, for example, he sees where we throw away the trash, so when we give him a box to throw away he knows where exactly to go. Whenever he sees someone waving at him, he waves back. He would start to dance if he see someone dancing, he would scream if somebody else screams, and he would clap his hands if he see someone clapping their hands.

                Eliseo likes to go shopping with my mom and sisters. He likes to visit some of my family members when its a holiday or celebration.
		He gets really hyper if he eats anything that has sugar in it. Unfortunately, he does not like to listen to us, so he does the opposite 
		of what we want him to do.
